* What is a good decision and what is a bad decision in css?
* What are the most common issues with css?
* How to think about css

## Notes

Let us ask the fundamental question, when does css become a problem?

Some will argue that the problem starts when you have legacy css.

But then the question becomes, what creates legacy css?

I will argue that legacy css comes from poor choices made at a previous
point in time, choices that lead to a snowball effect of patches when the
application grows and changes.

If we accept that what we know today will change tomorrow we need to design
our css to be easy to extend or update.
